## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Project Structure**
```
lib/
├── 📁 models/
│   ├── 📁 music_flutter/
│   ├── 📄 exercise.dart
│   └── 📄 workout.dart
├── 📁 screens/
│   ├── 📄 exercise_details_screen.dart
│   ├── 📄 exercises_screen.dart

│   └── 📄 workouts_screen.dart
└── 📄 main.dart
```

### **Simple Architecture Pattern**
The application follows a straightforward **screen-based architecture** with clear separation between:

- **Models**: Data structures for exercises and workouts
- **Screens**: UI components for different app sections  
- **Main**: Application entry point and navigation setup

### **File Organization**
- `models/`: Contains data models (`exercise.dart`, `workout.dart`) and music integration
- `screens/`: All UI screens organized by functionality
- `main.dart`: App initialization and routing configuration

### **Core Components**

#### **Models** (`lib/models/`)
- **exercise.dart**: Exercise data structure with properties like name, description, muscle groups
- **workout.dart**: Workout data structure containing exercise lists and metadata
- **music_flutter/**: Integration for workout music functionality

#### **Screens** (`lib/screens/`)
- **login_screen.dart**: User authentication interface
- **home_screen.dart**: Main dashboard with bottom navigation
- **exercises_screen.dart**: Browse and search exercises
- **exercise_details_screen.dart**: Detailed exercise information
- **workouts_screen.dart**: View available workout routines  
- **workout_details_screen.dart**: Complete workout information
